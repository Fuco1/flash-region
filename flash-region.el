;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides one function, `flash-region' that will
;; highlight a region with the supplied face for a specified amount
;; of time.  By default, the `highlight' face is used and the
;; timeout is set to 0.5

;;; Code:

(defvar flash-region-ovl nil
  "The overlay used for flash.")
(make-variable-buffer-local 'flash-region-ovl)

(defun flash-region--remove-ovl (buf)
  "Remove the flash overlay if it exists in BUF."
  (with-current-buffer buf
    (when (overlayp flash-region-ovl)
      (delete-overlay flash-region-ovl))
    (setq flash-region-ovl nil)))

;;;###autoload
(defun flash-region (beg end &optional face timeout)
  "Show an overlay from BEG to END using FACE to set display
properties.  The overlay automatically vanishes after TIMEOUT
seconds."
  (interactive "r")
  (setq face (or face 'highlight))
  (setq timeout (or (and (numberp timeout) (< 0 timeout) timeout) 0.5))
  (flash-region--remove-ovl (current-buffer))
  (setq flash-region-ovl (make-overlay beg end))
  (overlay-put flash-region-ovl 'face face)
  (when (< 0 timeout)
    (run-with-idle-timer timeout
                         nil 'flash-region--remove-ovl (current-buffer))))

(provide 'flash-region)
